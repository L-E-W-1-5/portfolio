    description: `I am very enthusiastic to learn as much as I can with regards to Software Development, since deciding it was time to change my career I have dived head first into this world and I couldn't be happier with my decision. The more I learn the more interested and more motivated I become to keep expanding my knowledge. \nAfter spending the past year and a half at first teaching myself C#, then enrolling myself in a 16 week bootcamp focussing on full stack web development I now feel that I am in a good place to start looking for my first role as a developer. \nI am excited by the opportunity to learn from industry professionals and gain a more in depth understanding of how to make robust, enterprise level applications. \nI am at a place where I feel confident in my ability to add value to any team I become a part of, especially since learning the value of the AGILE method of development and now being used to pair programming I am able to express my views, thoughts and opinions clearly and concisely when it comes to coding. \nWhile spending this time applying for jobs, I am enjoying the chance to continue creating applications and learning new technologies. This portfolio was a lot of fun to create, I decided on a Windows 95 theme since that is the same time period that I first got interested in computers so it has meaning to me on a personal level. It was a challenge experimenting with things I hadn't ever done before, for example being able to move components around the screen both on desktop and mobile devices. Now that this is complete I plan on using ASP.NET Web API for the backend to an e-commerce site and React for the front end. \nApart from my passion for coding, I also enjoy spending my free time keeping fit, I like to visit the gym and occasionally go jogging. I have found taking the time for these hobbies to be all the more important since beginning to spend so much time sat at my computer. I find it is good for both physical and mental health. I also enjoy playing video games and watching films if I decide to stay at home however I do prefer to get out as much as possible to make up for time already spent indoors.\nMy contact details can be found both on my CV or on the start menu of this portfolio. I would love to answer any questions you might have or to hear about any job opportunities or feedback on my work. 
\nThank You.`,
